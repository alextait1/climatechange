                <h2>The basics of climate change</h2>
                <div class="flex-row">
                    <p>The earth's atmosphere traps heat from the sun keeping the earth warm. This has created just the right conditions on earth to sustain life. The atmosphere contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but there are other gasses in it including carbon. Due to human burning of fossil fuels, the earth's atmosphere is trapping more and more carbon which is causing the temperature of the earth warm faster than it should by trapping extra heat from the sun.</p>
                    <img class="section-img" src="https://media-public.canva.com/BpKKA/MAF-OQBpKKA/1/s2.png"  alt="Illustration of a Polluted Earth with Industrial Emissions"></div>
                <p>This faster warming of the earth, otherwise known as "global warming" is causing a lot dangerous and extreme weather around the world. Due to the melting of artic ice, costal regions are particularly at risk from rising sea levels.</p>
                <p>We have the opportunity to slow the warming of the earth if we transition away from relying on fossil fuels for our energy.</p>

                <h2>Curriculum Connections</h2>
                <p>There are many direct ways to connect climate change to the science curriculum (examples below). The social studies curriculum offers connections to climate change through the grades in strand <strong>B. People and Environments</strong>. We can also look for cross-curricular opportunities like creating artworks about climate change, using climate change data in math, or as a subject for reading and writing in language.</p>
